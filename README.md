Overview of the analysis: 

The analysis of revenue in the early months of 2019 gives us a clear image of where PyBer is drawing the bulk of their earnings. The data also illustrates periods of increased or decreased demand from riders based on changes in revenue generated from fares. 

Results:

The urban component of the business generates the bulk of the company’s revenue. From January through to the later part of February we see a gradual increase in revenue from fares. March has much less stability with revenue dropping and rising from week to week, until April. April sees two weeks of stability before a decline in revenue.
Suburban riders use PyBer more throughout January and February. There was a peak toward the end of February, and then ridership dropped and stabilized at lower level compared to earlier weeks.
Rural city residents use PyBer much less frequently than suburban and urban residents. There are minor increases and decreases from week to week throughout the entirety of the January through April time span. 

Summary: (three business recommendations)

A recommendation to try to capitalize on the urban component to the business would be to ensure that the service is efficient and easily accessed by these users. By creating a reputation for having an easy and reliable experience there is more chance people will consider using the service often.
The suburban communities have little fluctuation in their use of PyBer until a sharp drop in March. It might be that there is something unique to that month that has people using the service less. If workers are taking a vacation from their places of employment, they may be less inclined to need the service often. If that is the case, trying to minimize operating expenses during that period would be beneficial to the company’s profitability.
The rural cities are less likely to commonly use this service. Rural communities are more remote, and residents there are more commonly going to have access to their own vehicles. If the expense of operating out of these communities diminishes profitability there may be a case for reducing or ending service in these areas. Alternatively, if there is a push to try to create more PyBer users here, offering rides with lower fares might appeal to people and see the ride-share model as a practical means of travel.
